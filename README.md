# Trading-Experts
This project implements an expert aggregation trading bot inspired by Hagelbarger’s SEER (1956) and early “mind-reading” machines. Instead of hard-coding a single trading rule, the bot combines multiple simple experts (predictors) and lets a meta-algorithm learn which expert to trust in different market regimes.
